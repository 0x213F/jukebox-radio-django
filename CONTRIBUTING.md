# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

Here are some important resources to get yourself situated:

  * [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/0x213F/jukebox-radio-django/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) as a reminder to treat others with respect.
  * [Definitions](https://github.com/0x213F/jukebox-radio/wiki/Definitions) so you can keep up with the lingo.
  * [Wiki](https://github.com/0x213F/jukebox-radio/wiki) page with links to lots more.
  * [Discussion](https://github.com/0x213F/jukebox-radio-django/discussions/12) is a public forum to discuss engineering milestones.

## What to do
  
We want you working on things you're excited about.

Jukebox Radio has a well defined timeline, as established by the MBC. Features and bugs that are selected for immediate development have an accelerated timeline and are typically picked up by core maintainer staff (josh@0x213F.com).

Any features that don't have a sense of immediacy (any feature that is scheduled to be done in 2+ months) is fair game for you to work on. There are a large number of tasks that fall under this categorization. See the [Feature Requests](https://github.com/0x213F/jukebox-radio/wiki/Feature-requests) wiki page for the full list.

## Where to start

You need to do 2 things to get started:

  * Signal to a core maintainer (josh@0x213F.com) that you would like to start contributing so you may be assigned a task.
  * Start setting up your local developer enviornment by following [README.md](https://github.com/0x213F/jukebox-radio-django/blob/main/README.md).
